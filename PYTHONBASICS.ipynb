It's used for a variety of tasks, including web development, data science, and machine learning.\n","  - Python is popular because:\n","  Easy to learn: Python's syntax is similar to English, making it easy for beginners to learn.\n","  Versatile: Python is a general-purpose language that can be used to create many different types of programs.\n","  Runs on many platforms: Python works on Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, and other platforms.\n","  Integrates well: Python integrates well with many types of systems.\n","  Large libraries: Python has many libraries and frameworks that can save time and effort during development.\n","  Academic language: Python is often taught in schools and colleges, so many computer science students are introduced to it early in their education.\n","\n","2. what is an interpreter in python?\n","  - A python interpreter is a computer program that converts each high-level program statement into machine code. An interpreter translates the command that you write out into code that the computer can understand.\n","\n","3. what are predefined keywords in python?\n","  - Python Keywords are some predefined and reserved words in Python that have special meanings. Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding. The keyword cannot be used as an identifier, function, or variable name. All the keywords in Python are written in lowercase except True and False.\n","\n","4. can keywords be used as variable names?\n","  - No, you cannot use keywords as variable names in Python. Keywords are used to define the structure and syntax of the Python language.\n","\n","5. what is mutability in python\n","  - In Python, mutability refers to whether an object's value can change after it's created. Mutable objects can be changed in place, meaning that modifying an object in one part of a program can change it in another part.\n","  Examples of mutable objects lists, dictionaries, and sets.\n","  Examples of immutable objects numbers, strings, bools, and tuples.\n","\n","6. why are lists mutable but tuples are immutable?\n","  - The main difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation, while lists are mutable and can be modified. Additionally, tuples are more memory-efficient compared to lists.\n","  Tuples can't be changed after they're created, but lists can be modified. Tuples use less memory than lists. They are also a bit faster, especially when you're just looking up values. So, if you have data that you don't want to change, it's better to use tuples instead of lists.\n","\n","7. what is the difference between == and is in python?\n","  - In Python, the == operator compares the values of two objects, while the is operator compares the identities of two objects.\n","  Explanation\n","  ==\n","  The == operator is used to compare the values of two objects. It's also known as the equality operator. For example, if you compare two cats with the == operator, you'd get the answer \"both cats are equal\".\n","  is\n","  The is operator is used to compare the identities of two objects. It's also known as the identity operator. For example, if you compare two cats with the is operator, you'd get the answer \"these are two different cats\".\n","\n","8. what are logical operators in python?\n","  - Logical operators in Python are keywords that connect and evaluate multiple conditions in a single expression. They are used to make decisions based on specific conditions.\n","  The three logical operators in Python\n","  And: Returns true if both conditions are true\n","  Or: Returns true if either condition is true\n","  Not: Reverses the result, returning false if the result is true.\n","\n","9. what is type casting in python?\n","  - Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of changing a variable's data type to another data type in Python. It's a useful feature for making Python code more versatile and ensuring compatibility between different data types.\n","  Types of type casting\n","  Implicit\n","  Python automatically converts one data type to another without the programmer's input. This is common when performing operations on mixed data types.\n","  Explicit\n","  The programmer uses predefined functions to convert an object's data type to the desired data type.\n","  Examples of type casting\n","  Converting an integer to a float\n","  Converting a string to a list\n","  Converting a character to an integer\n","  Converting an integer to a hexadecimal string\n","  Converting an integer to an octal string\n","  Functions used for type casting\n","  int(): Constructs an integer value from a float or string\n","  float(): Constructs a float value from an integer or string\n","  str(): Constructs a string value from a given data type\n","  ord(): Converts a character to an integer\n","  hex(): Converts an integer to a hexadecimal string\n","  oct(): Converts an integer to an octal string\n","\n","10. what is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","  - Conditional statements in Python control the flow of a program by executing code based on certain conditions. They are used to make decisions in code, which can make programs more efficient and easier to read.\n","11. what is the purpose of conditional statements in python?\n","  - The program evaluates the condition-\n","   If the condition is true, the code block associated with the condition is executed.\n","   If the condition is false, the code block associated with the condition is not executed.\n","   Examples of conditional statements\n","   If statements: Run a section of code if a condition is true\n","   If-else statements: Can be used to separate even and odd numbers\n","   Nested if statements: Can be used to check if a year is a leap year\n","   Conditional expressions: Can be used to print or assign one of two values based on a condition.\n","\n","12. how does the elif statement work in python?\n","    - The “elif” keyword in Python, stands for “else if”. It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions. For example, if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for loop and while loop?\n","  - For Loop:\n","   When there is a need of iteration over elements that are in sequence like lists, tuples, strings or dictionaries.\n","   Use for loops when a known number or a finite number of iteration is required.\n","   Another situation when you want that each element of a sequence should pass through iteration one by one.\n","   for loops can also be used when a task requires a sequential access of elements of a sequence.\n","    - While Loop:\n","   When there is a need to repeat execution of a block of code until a specified condition becomes False.\n","   Use while loops when the number of iteration is not determined.\n","   while loops are can be used when there is a need to repeat execution based on a condition.\n","   When dynamic adaptation is required based upon condition that may change.\n","\n","14. describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop in python?\n","    - The for loop is used when we already know the number of iterations, which means when we know how many times a statement has to be executed. That is why we have to specify the ending point in the for loop initialization. When we need to end the loop on a condition other than the number of times, we use a while loop.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"SmWvLnr78y-9"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1.
